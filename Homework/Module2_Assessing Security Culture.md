## Assessing Security Culture

Make a copy of this document to work in, and then answer each question below the prompt. Save and submit this completed file as your Challenge deliverable.


### Step 1: Measure and Set Goals



1. Using outside research, indicate the potential security risks of allowing employees to access work information on their personal devices. Identify at least three potential attacks that can be carried out.

    `Packet sniffing work data over an unsecured connection`
    `Spyware moving from a personal device onto the work network`
    `Man-In-The-Middle attack via wifi spoofing`


2. Based on the previous scenario, what is the preferred employee behavior? (For example, if employees were downloading suspicious email attachments, the preferred behavior would be that employees only download attachments from trusted sources.)

    `Employees only connect to secure connections`
    `Employees only download apps from trusted sources`
    `Employees only connect to known & encrypted wifi access points`


3. What methods would you use to measure how often employees are currently _not_ behaving according to the preferred behavior? (For example, conduct a survey to see how often people download email attachments from unknown senders.)

    `Inspect database logs to determine % of times key business files are accessed via secure or unsecured connections`
    `Survey employees to determine how many access work emails/files over open wifi networks, and how regularly they `
    `Create an open wifi network in a nearby cafe and measure how many devices known to belong to employees connect to it`


4. What is the goal that you would like the organization to reach regarding this behavior? (For example, to have less than 5% of employees downloading suspicious email attachments.)

    `Have less than 2% of employees accessing the work network over unsecured wifi networks`


### Step 2: Involve the Right People


5. List at least five employees or departments that should be involved. For each person or department, describe in 2–3 sentences what their role and responsibilities will be.

    `CEO - Overall awareness of company activities and potential corporate approval for security solutions. The CEO needs to have the company's overall vision in mind, and to help determine if a potential solution is beneficial overall to the company's strategic goals and culture.`
    `CFO - Determining the budget available for security solutions. While the CFO may not be involved directly in the implementation of these solutions, they have an important role to play in making sure the cost isn't excessive or damaging to the overall profits.`
    `CISO - Determining if a security solution is worth the time/effort/cost of initial and on-going implementation, and whether a solution may create (or solve) other security concerns. The CISO will also be responsible for negotiating with the CEO and CFO to determine how a potential security solution will impact other business segments, as well as potential regulatory & compliance concerns` 
    `IT - Providing the CISO and other departments with statistics on number of devices and % of non-compliant access. The IT department could also suggest and potentially implement alternative controls that reduce or remove the need for ongoing employee training.`
    `Training - Developing and delivering employee training to try and correct non-compliance. Also responsible for reporting potential training gaps and providing alternative training solutions to reduce work disruption.`
    `HR - Developing an updated IT security policy that makes clear the requirements for using BYO devices accessing the company network. Tracking training delivery to ensure it's being conducted in a consistent manner for all employees that require it. Tracking reported cases of employee non-compliance and counselling/disciplinary action for employees found to be in breach.`

### Step 3: Training Plan



6. How frequently will you run training? What format will it take (e.g., in-person, online, a combination of both)?

    `Training delivered to 25% of employees per quarter (training completed by all employees annually) and delivered as an online program developed internally or delivered by an external online training vendor.`


7. What topics will you cover in your training, and why? (This should be the bulk of the deliverable.)

    `Packet sniffing, to raise awareness that data is not secure if transmitted over an open/unencrypted network. Employees should understand that if they're using a mobile device to connect to a wireless access point, none of the data is encrypted unless that access point is secure (eg. using WEP, WPA, WPA2). Education on how malicious actors can steal data directly over unsecured networks - both by packet sniffing and by creating malicious wifi hotspots. If you didn't put in a password to connect to the wifi, then there's a good chance someone else can read every piece of data you're sending or receiving.
How to identify and connect to secure wireless access points. Reviewing different types of wireless encryption (WEP, WPA/2), how to check which you're using, and why it should be WPA2 (but anything is better than open). What steps are involved in connecting to a secure wireless access point, and things to watch out for if you're connecting to something new/unknown.`


8. After you’ve run your training, how will you measure its effectiveness? 

    `Use of a wireless intrusion prevention system to monitor unsecured wireless access points.`
    `Reviewing logs on key company files to when they're being accessed over an unsecured network.`
    `Sending employees a survey/quiz 3 months after completion of their training to measure retention and determine areas of poor understanding to help refine training in the future.`
