## Activity File: SPL Search

- As the SOC manager at OMP, you are asked to analyze the company's vulnerability scanning logs in order to determine the vulnerabilities of OMP's technical assets. 

- To accomplish this, you must design SPL searches to run against the vulnerability scanning log file `nessus.txt`.

- These searches can be used to quickly look up existing vulnerabilities on your operating systems or devices.

### Instructions

1. Using SPL, design searches to display the following data from the `nessus` logs:

    - Display results where OS contains "Windows". `os="Microsoft Windows*" has 408 events (Two versions of XP and Server 2008)`

    - Display results where OS contains "Linux". `os="Linux*" has 344 events (Two versions of Linux Kernel)`
    
    - Display results where dest_ip is 10.11.36.4. `dest_ip="10.11.36.4" has 15 events`
    
    - Display results where dest_ip starts with 10.12.34. `dest_ip="10.12.34.*" has 670 events`
      - **Hint:** Use wildcards in your searches.

2. Run your designed queries within Splunk and determine the count returned for each query.

#### Bonus

- Design an SPL search to display results where the signature contains an RDP man-in-the-middle weakness. `signature="Microsoft Windows Remote Desktop Protocol Server Man-in-the-Middle Weakness" has 152 events`
