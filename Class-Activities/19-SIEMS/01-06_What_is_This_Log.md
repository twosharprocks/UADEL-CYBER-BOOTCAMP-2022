## Activity File: What is this Log Activity

You are a recently hired SOC manager at OMP.

- One of your first tasks as SOC manager is to understand the types of logs available for monitoring.

- Your predecessor left you with a directory labeled `logs` containing various log files.

- Unfortunately, there is no indication of what each log type is for. You must analyze and categorize each log.


### Instructions

1. Analyze the five raw log files provided.

2. Determine the type of each log file and note your reasoning.

    - **Hint:** Look for keywords or phrases in each log file to determine the type of log.

3. Provide a brief summary of the security events that each log file identifies.

` Log1 - FORTIGUARD Log, identifying a Denial-of-Service attack against the Oracle 9i TNS Listener`
` Log2 - Linux Logs, with user changing user groups`
` Log3 - Web Application logs showing GET requests`
` Log4 - Windows security logs, with user creation and process execution`
` Log5 - Online Shopping cart contents log`
