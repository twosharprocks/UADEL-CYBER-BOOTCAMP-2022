## Activity File: Alert - C2 Beacon

In this activity, you will continue your role as an SOC analyst for the California Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).

- Your organization has just experienced another, more sophisticated attack. Itâ€™s a red alert that Snort has identified as an emerging threat: a C2 beacon acknowledgement attack.

- The entire network is down across the state. As long as the network is down, none of the DMV offices can issue or renew licenses and registrations, or complete driving tests.

- As part of the Computer Incident and Response Team (CIRT), you need to establish an attacker profile that includes the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by the adversary, and document all of your findings. Like a real security analyst, you may need to research other sources to answer all the questions.
