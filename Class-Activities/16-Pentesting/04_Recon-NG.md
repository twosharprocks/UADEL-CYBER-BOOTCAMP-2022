## Activity File: Recon-ng

- In this activity, you will continue to play the role of a pentester conducting an engagement on MegaCorpOne. 
- You are tasked with determining whether MegaCorpOne's domain server info is accessible using OSINT tools.
- You will use the Shodan API and Recon-ng to perform your tests, and then you'll place all of your findings in a report.

⚠️ **Reminder** - Don't forget to save your findings, as you will add them to your report on Day 4!


### Instructions
 
1. In Kali, log in with the credentials `root:kali` and start Recon-ng.

   -  In Recon-ng, run `modules search` to view all of the currently installed modules.

   - Run `modules load recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget`.
 
   - This will load the `hackertarget` scanner module.
 
   - Modules need to be loaded prior to use. 

2. In Recon-ng, type the command to view all of the currently installed modules.
 
   - For this activity, we'll use the following two modules:
 
     - `recon/domains-hosts/hackertarget`
     - `reporting/html`

3. Type the command that will query hackettarget.com for a scan against megacorpone.com.

   - The results will automatically display verbosely in the terminal window.
 
4. Install the reporting module then use the module.

	- `marketplace install reporting/html`

5. Type the command that shows which parameters need to be set.
 
   - The `CREATOR` and `CUSTOMER` parameters need to be set.
 
   - Set the parameters as follows:
   
      - `CREATOR`: Pentester
      - `CUSTOMER`: MegaCorpOne
 
   - Type the command that runs the query so the results are saved to `/root/.recon-ng/workspaces/default/results.html`.
   `Open file manager and search "xdg-open /root/.recon-ng/workspaces/default/results.html"`
    
   - Type the command that verifies whether the configuration took effect after setting the options.
 
6. View the report.

    - Generate the report so that it can be viewed as HTML in the web browser.
